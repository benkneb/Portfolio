                        <p class="text-white me-3" style="font-weight: 300;">Icarus is a liquid bipropellant rocket that
                            runs on Nitrous Oxide and Isopropyl Alcohol. It produces a maximum of 2,500 pounds of
                            thrust, and will fly in early March of 2025 to 26,000 feet. It is designed to be a minimum
                            viable rocket to get the Boston University Rocket Propulsion Group off of the ground. Icarus
                            was designed, built, and tested rapidly, going from the first element of design to tested in
                            just over a year. A team of 25+ member work on Icarus, with tasks ranging from structural
                            design to propulsion (my team) to custom electronics. When brought together, the result is
                            pretty cool.</p>

                        <p class="text-white me-3" style="font-weight: 300;">I serve as the responsible engineer and
                            lead for all fluids and propulsion systems on the rocket. I lead 5+ members of the fluid and
                            propulsion team, where collectively we design, build, test, and operate all fluid and
                            propulsion components of the rocket. Additionally, during testing of the rocket, I serve as
                            the test director, ensuring that all personnel are safe, all procedures are completed
                            correctly, and that all test objectives are met. After tests, I verify all performance and
                            test data and troubleshoot any issues related to performance of the rocket. Since the
                            successful ground test campaign of the rocket wrapped up, I have been responsible for the
                            final flight simulations of the rocket, to determine the likely landing location of the
                            rocket, the maximum altitude, and various other key parameters for members of the team.
                            Additionally, as an executive board member, I am one of 4 people who arrange all operations
                            and logistics to get both the rocket and the team from Boston to the Mojave desert for
                            launch.</p>

                                the ability to test the system modularly, rapidly accelerating test operations. I

                                pneumatic piston that actuated a traditional quick disconnect fitting. This design was
                                incredibly overcomplicated, and involved moving parts which could be unpredictable in a
                                moment where it just needs to work. So the solution was a 3D printed AN fitting, which
                                would just snap from the motion of the rocket as it launches.</p>

                                dream of ideal performance, with so many nice-to-haves, and just imagine it working
                                immediately. In reality, there's always some issue in your build. One of the great
                                lessons I've learned from Icarus is to just get the rocket to testing. Design, build,
                                and test each component as soon as you can. Testing will find some issue, and it may
                                undo all your hours spent optimizing. Finally, don't get stuck on one problem in the
                                field. If you have the bandwidth, always work in parallel and reduce the time to your
                                test. A test day always goes quicker than you think.</p>

                                short of incredible. The incredibly talented, hardworking people who I have worked
