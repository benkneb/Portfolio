                        <h2 class="text-primary mb-4">Project Overview</h2>
                        <p class="text-white me-3">The Horizontal Test Stand, or HTS, is the Boston University Rocket
                            Propulsion Group's (BURPG) flagship test stand. Capable of testing engines with up to 10,000
                            pounds of thrust, the project had been under development for quite a while when I first
                            joined BURPG. The stand had many ambitious goals, including a bang-bang pressurization
                            system. The team's leadership refocused the stand to become the minimum viable test stand to
                            fire the Iron Lotus engine, so work begun to build up a feed system compatible with the
                            engine.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-primary mt-4 mb-4">My Contributions</h2>
                        <p class="text-white me-3">When I first joined BURPG, my first task was to create a 12 volt
                            power supply system for servo actuated ball valves on HTS. I designed, routed, and soldered
                            all wiring for it as well as choosing and mounting a 12 volt power supply to the tank stand
                            panel on HTS. Once I completed all wiring, the test stand was tested in the lab and seemed
                            to work as expected. However, upon deployment, issues were observed with the servo ball
                            valves. Upon returning, all ball valves were removed, and it became the team's job to source
                            solenoid valves and pneumatic ball valves to replace the servos. All valves were replaced
                            and tested, and the stand was ready for another deployment.</p>
                        <p class="text-white me-3">For future deployments of the stand, the team wanted a network camera
                            to view the stand while it was unsafe for personnel to be nearby. The network camera
                            purchased did not initially work due to a network configuration issue, and I was tasked with
                            fixing it. I fixed the network camera, as well as rebuilding the stands's electrical ground
                            service equipment (GSE) box, which contains a network switch, power supply, and 12 volt
                            inverter for the test
                            stand's computers, as well as power over ethernet (PoE) injectors for the antenas used to
                            communicate with the test stand from far away. The full setup was tested in the lab, and
                            worked once deployed to the test site.</p>
                        <p class="text-white me-3">As the team deployed the stand, a group of members referred to as the
                            red team had the task to ensure the test stand was prepared for propellant load and test. I
                            was placed on the red team, with my tasks being to run dry and wet clicks of the test stand
                            and troubleshoot any issues that appear with the stand, as well as connecting and opening
                            both gaseous nitrogen and nitrous oxide gas bottles to the test stand. Additionally, I
                            installed the igniter in the Iron Lotus engine. After the test stand fired, I would be one
                            of the first people to return to the test stand and ensure the system is safed and clear to
                            approach for the rest of the team.</p>
                        <p class="text-white me-3">Once elected to the executive board, I became the test director for
                            all HTS tests. This meant I was responsible for ensuring the safety of all team members, as
                            well as running all test operations and ensuring that all test objectives were acheived, and
                            all procedures are completed correctly.</p>
                        <p class="text-white me-3 mb-5">I am now leading the team in upgrading the test stand. This
                            includes
                            making more of the flex hoses on the test stand into metal flex tubes, introduce a
                            differential pressure transducer to measure the fill level of the oxidizer tank, and
                            introduce a high flow regulator to the fuel tank. Additionally, we are planning to support
                            cryogenic oxidizers, allowing the test stand to work with almost any propellant that the
                            team can get its hands on. The stand will also be prepared for the
                            team's future engines, so that they can be tested as quickly as possible on a working and
                            characterized test stand.</p>

                        <p class="text-white me-3">For the first static fire test of the Horizontal Test Stand, I was in
                            charge of coordinating the red team's final tasks so that we could exit the test site
                            quickly and safely once all were complete. I was the one to open the nitrous oxide bottles,
                            as well as insert the igniter. Additionally, after successful static fire, I was among the
                            first people to return to the test stand, and was responsible for closing and safing nitrous
                            oxide systems on the test stand.</p>
